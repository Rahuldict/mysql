    "'''A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way to allow efficient retrieval, storage, and manipulation of data. It acts as a central repository to store and manage data for various applications and systems. Databases come in various types, but the two main categories are SQL databases and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Database:\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are traditional relational databases that use a structured schema to define the data model. They store data in tables, where each table has predefined columns and data types, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, data integrity, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Database:\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide a flexible data model. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for modern web applications and big data scenarios. NoSQL databases offer horizontal scalability and can handle large amounts of data with high performance. They don't require a fixed schema and can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, document-based, column-family, or graph-based. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, etc.'''"
